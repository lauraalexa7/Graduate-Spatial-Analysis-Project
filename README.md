Spatial Prediction and Regression Analysis of Homeless Populations in Chattanooga, TN

**##1. Project Design**
-Gather Point in Time counts of the homeless population of the Greater Chattanooga Area from organizations in Chattanooga that service the homeless population.

-Then perform spatial analysis to show the areas in which the homeless population tend to be most highly represented, as well as areas in which high populations of the homeless exist without adequate resources in the immediate area to service this population. 

-Perform regression analysis is to gain a better understanding of the contributing factors of homelessness in the Greater Chattanooga Area. 

-Perform spatial prediction analysis for potentially predicting areas in which homeless populations might gather in the Greater Chattanooga Area in the future.

##**2. Project Implementation**
-PIT counts of the homeless populations in the Greater Chattanooga Area were gathered from local homeless service organizations, # of individuals encountered, as well as numbers of homeless encampments and numbers of individuals utilizing shelters in 2017 and 2018. 

-Organizations in Chattanooga that service the homeless, including shelters, food kitchens, and medical centers are also spatially represented. 
This data was then analyzed using ESRI GIS tools.

-Both Explanatory and Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis processes were performed.

##**3. Explanatory Variables**
-The optimized explanatory variables used in the regression analysis are: 1) Population 2) Household Median Income 3) Number of Households under Poverty Level 4) Number of Adults with No High School Diploma 5) Unemployment 6) Number of Individuals Utilizing Public Transportation.

-The explanatory variables chosen for Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis were in chose in consideration with the contributing factors of homelessness cited in research (local and otherwise), as well as the data available for regression analysis within available analysis tools. 

-These variables were optimized using exploratory regression analysis prior to OLS. 

-The regression analysis was also modeled on an Esri Regression learning module titled Street Kids â€“ Geography and risk for homeless by Deden Rukmana.
